# Inference System Example

## Network Setup

### MAIN NET WALLET

```
DATA...
Human
+Head
Duck
+Beak
```

### COMPANY A WALLET

```
DATA ...
Human isnt Duck
```

### COMPANY B WALLET

```
DATA ...
Human isnt Duck
```

## Mining Process

### MINER

**COMPANY A WALLET, COMPANY B WALLET**

```
SAME DATA...
Human isnt Duck
| |
| | INFERRENCE / MERGING process
| |
```

### Result: MAIN NET WALLET

```
Duck
+Beak
Human
+Head
+Eye
-Duck (Duck of MAIN NET WALLET) {
    // Inferring that because Duck has a Beak and Human isnt a Duck, Human isnt Beak
    -Beak
}
```

## Inference Logic

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather all concept relationships from participating wallets
2. **Conflict Detection**: Identify contradictory relationships
3. **Consensus Building**: Determine which relationships to keep
4. **Inference Engine**: Apply logical rules to derive new relationships
5. **Validation**: Verify that inferred relationships are consistent

### Example Inference Rule

```
IF Duck has Beak
AND Human isnt Duck
THEN Human isnt Beak
```

### Key Principles

- **Transitivity**: If A is B and B is C, then A is C
- **Contradiction Resolution**: Explicit relationships override inferred ones
- **Consensus**: Multiple sources agreeing on a relationship increases confidence
- **Validation**: All inferred relationships must be logically consistent

## Benefits

1. **Automatic Discovery**: Finds implicit relationships between concepts
2. **Consistency**: Ensures logical coherence across the knowledge base
3. **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for explicit relationship definitions
4. **Scalability**: Handles complex concept hierarchies automatically
