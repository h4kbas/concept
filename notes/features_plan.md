# Product Features

## 1.0 Semantic Data

The network keeps only schemas and their data. **Reading is free** and **writing requires a price**.

### 1.1 Schemas

Schemas and data are actually in the same form but they are kept separate here to be explained clearly.

### 1.2 Data Types

#### 1.2.1 Public

- This data can be read freely from the network anytime by anyone
- No cost associated with reading public data
- Examples: Basic concept definitions, public knowledge

#### 1.2.2 Private

- This data can only be read by the owner of the data
- Encrypted and access-controlled
- Examples: Personal concept relationships, private knowledge

#### 1.2.3 Paid

- This data can be read only if the reader pays the price
- Monetization model for valuable data
- Examples: Premium concept libraries, specialized knowledge

## 2.0 Network Coin / Finance

Network coin has two main purposes:

1. **Payment for data access** - to buy data or write your own data
2. **Miner's tip** - incentive for miners to process and validate data
