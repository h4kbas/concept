Lang Decl

- Concepts are the atomic parts of the langauge
- The purpose of this language is to define and relate concepts and resolve them until the end depth.
- The end is called Terminal which cannot be resolved more depth.
- Concepts can interact with each other.
- If the interaction can be resolved, they are called hooked terminals
- If the interaction cannot be resolved, they are called loose terminals
- If there is a single concept at the end depth, it is called pure terminal

Therefore, is/isnt actually a loose terminal which can either be hooked and calculated by a parser like compiler or runtime.
