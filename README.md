# Concept Language

A semantic network system for defining concepts, their relationships, and building knowledge graphs that can be used across various domains. Discover implicit relationships through automatic inference and interact with external resources through a powerful plugin system.

## What is Concept Language?

Concept Language is a **semantic network system** designed to model knowledge through concepts and their relationships. It enables you to define structured data, discover implicit connections, and build semantic networks that can be used across various areas including AI, data science, knowledge management, and more.

### Core Philosophy

- **Concepts are atomic** - The fundamental building blocks of knowledge
- **Relationships define meaning** - How concepts connect and interact
- **Schema and data together** - Define structure alongside actual data
- **Automatic inference** - Discover relationships you haven't explicitly defined
- **Plugin hooks** - Tap into concepts to make them useful and interactive

## How It Works

### 1. Define Concepts and Relationships

Create semantic networks using natural syntax:

```concept
# Basic concept definitions
Human is entity
Duck is entity
Eye is feature
Beak is feature
Intelligent is property

# Explicit relationships
Human has Eye
Duck has Beak
Human isnt Duck
Duck has Eye
```

### 2. Automatic Inference

The system automatically discovers implicit relationships:

```concept
# Given these explicit relationships:
Duck has Beak
Human isnt Duck

# The system infers:
Human hasnt Beak
```

### 3. Schema with Data

Define structure and data together:

```concept
# Schema definition
user_schema is
    name is string
    email is string
    role is string
    age is number

# Data using the schema
alice is user_schema
    name is Alice
    email is alice@example.com
    role is admin
    age is 30
```

### 4. Plugin Hooks

Plugins can hook into concepts to make them useful:

```concept
# Database plugin hooks into data concepts
db store users
    name is Alice
    email is alice@example.com
    role is admin

# HTTP plugin hooks into API concepts
http expose users
    endpoint is /api/users
    method is GET
    return users

# File plugin hooks into document concepts
file save report
    content is user_analysis
    format is json
    path is ./reports/
```

## Core Features

### Semantic Network Building

#### **Concept Definition**

```concept
# Define atomic concepts
Person is entity
Company is organization
Project is work_item
Skill is capability
```

#### **Relationship Modeling**

```concept
# Define relationships between concepts
Alice is Person
Alice works_at Acme_Corp
Acme_Corp is Company
Alice has_skill Programming
Programming is Skill
```

#### **Hierarchical Relationships**

```concept
# Build concept hierarchies
Developer is Person
Senior_Developer is Developer
Alice is Senior_Developer

# The system infers:
Alice is Person
Alice is Developer
```

### Automatic Inference

The system discovers implicit relationships:

```concept
# Given:
Duck has Beak
Human isnt Duck
Bird has Beak
Duck is Bird

# System infers:
Human isnt Bird
Human hasnt Beak
```

### Schema and Data Integration

#### **Define Structure with Data**

```concept
# Schema definition
product_schema is
    name is string
    price is number
    category is string
    in_stock is boolean

# Data instances
laptop is product_schema
    name is MacBook Pro
    price is 2000
    category is electronics
    in_stock is true
```

#### **Nested Structures**

```concept
# Complex nested schemas
user_profile is
    personal_info is
        name is string
        age is number
        email is string
    work_info is
        company is string
        position is string
        department is string
    preferences is
        theme is string
        notifications is boolean
```

### Plugin System

Plugins hook into concepts to provide functionality:

#### **Database Plugin**

```concept
# Hook data concepts to database storage
db create users
    name is string
    email is string
    role is string

db insert users
    name is Alice
    email is alice@example.com
    role is admin

# Query based on relationships
db select users
    where role is admin
    and name contains Alice
```

#### **HTTP Plugin**

```concept
# Hook concepts to web APIs
http endpoint GET /api/users
    return users
    filter active
    sort by name

http endpoint POST /api/concepts
    input concept_data
    validate schema
    store in database
```

#### **File Plugin**

```concept
# Hook concepts to file system
file write knowledge_base.json
    content is concept_network
    format is json
    pretty_print is true

file read schema.concept
    parse as concepts
    load into memory
```

#### **DateTime Plugin**

```concept
# Hook time concepts to date operations
created_at is datetime now
updated_at is datetime add 1 hour to created_at
expires_at is datetime add 30 days to created_at
```

Person is entity
Skill is capability
Company is organization

# Define relationships
Alice is Person
Programming is Skill
Acme_Corp is Company

# Explicit relationships
Alice has_skill Programming
Alice works_at Acme_Corp

# The system will infer additional relationships
```

### Run It

```bash
concept run knowledge.concept
```

### Run with Plugins

## Philosophy

Concept Language is built on the belief that **knowledge should be represented as interconnected concepts, not isolated data**.

- **Relationships matter** - How concepts connect defines meaning
- **Inference is powerful** - Discover what you didn't explicitly state
- **Schema and data together** - Structure and content in one place
- **Plugins extend reality** - Make concepts useful in the real world
