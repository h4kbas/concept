# Concept Language

A revolutionary programming language that lets you express ideas, relationships, and data operations using natural, human-readable syntax. Write code that reads like English and think in concepts, not syntax.

## What is Concept Language?

Concept Language is a new way to program that focuses on **what you want to achieve** rather than **how to achieve it**. Instead of writing complex code with brackets, semicolons, and technical jargon, you describe your ideas using natural language patterns.

### The Core Idea

```concept
# Instead of: const user = { name: "Alice", age: 30, role: "admin" };
# You write:
user is
    name is Alice
    age is 30
    role is admin

# Instead of: if (user.role === "admin") { console.log("Welcome admin"); }
# You write:
is user role admin
    say Welcome admin
```

## Why Concept Language?

### üß† **Think in Ideas, Not Syntax**
- Express complex relationships naturally
- Focus on the problem, not the programming
- Write code that anyone can understand

### üîó **Built-in Relationships**
- Define how concepts relate to each other
- Automatic inference and reasoning
- Natural data modeling

### üéØ **Purpose-Built Operations**
- Database operations that read like English
- HTTP APIs that describe themselves
- File operations that make sense

## Core Language Features

### Simple Relationships
```concept
# Basic relationships
Alice is a person
Alice is 30 years old
Alice works at Acme Corp
Alice is friends with Bob
```

### Structured Data with Tabbed Blocks
```concept
# Define complex data structures
user_profile is
    personal_info is
        name is Alice Johnson
        age is 30
        email is alice@example.com
    work_info is
        company is Acme Corp
        position is Senior Developer
        department is Engineering
    preferences is
        theme is dark
        notifications is enabled
        language is English
```

### Conditional Logic
```concept
# Natural conditional statements
is user age greater_than 18
    allow access
    show adult content

is user role admin
    grant full permissions
    enable debug mode
```

### Data Operations
```concept
# Database operations that make sense
db create users
    name is string
    email is string
    role is string
    created_at is timestamp

db insert users
    name is Alice
    email is alice@example.com
    role is admin
    created_at is now

db select users
    where role is admin
    order by name
    limit 10
```

### Web APIs
```concept
# HTTP endpoints that describe themselves
http endpoint GET /api/users
    return users
    filter active
    sort by name
    limit 50

http endpoint POST /api/users
    validate required fields
    check email format
    create new user
    return success message
```

## Real-World Example: Task Manager

Here's a complete task management application written in Concept Language:

```concept
# Create the database
db create tasks
    id is string
    title is string
    description is string
    status is string
    priority is string
    created_at is timestamp

db create users
    id is string
    username is string
    email is string
    role is string

# Add some tasks
db insert tasks
    id is task-001
    title is Design new feature
    description is Create wireframes and mockups
    status is in_progress
    priority is high
    created_at is 2025-01-04T10:00:00Z

# Set up the API
http endpoint GET /api/tasks
    return tasks
    filter by status
    sort by priority

http endpoint POST /api/tasks
    validate title is required
    validate description is required
    create new task
    return task details

# Start the server
http start
```

## What Makes It Different?

### üé® **Natural Syntax**
- No brackets, semicolons, or complex punctuation
- Reads like documentation
- Self-documenting code

### üß© **Conceptual Thinking**
- Model real-world relationships
- Think in terms of "what is" rather than "how to"
- Automatic inference and reasoning

### üîß **Built-in Intelligence**
- Understands relationships between concepts
- Can infer new information from existing data
- Reduces boilerplate code

### üåê **Universal Understanding**
- Non-programmers can read and understand the code
- Business logic is clear and obvious
- Perfect for documentation and communication

## Getting Started

### Installation
```bash
npm install -g concept-lang
```

### Your First Concept File
Create a file called `hello.concept`:
```concept
# Say hello to the world
say Hello World

# Define a person
person is
    name is Alice
    age is 30
    greeting is Hello, I am Alice

# Use the person
say person greeting
```

### Run It
```bash
concept run hello.concept
```

## Use Cases

### üìä **Data Modeling**
- Define complex data structures naturally
- Model business relationships
- Create self-documenting schemas

### üåê **Web Development**
- Build APIs that describe themselves
- Create readable server logic
- Focus on business rules, not technical details

### ü§ñ **AI and Machine Learning**
- Define knowledge bases
- Model relationships between concepts
- Create reasoning systems

### üìù **Documentation**
- Write executable documentation
- Create living specifications
- Bridge the gap between ideas and code

## Philosophy

Concept Language is built on the belief that **programming should be about expressing ideas, not fighting syntax**. 

- **Clarity over cleverness**
- **Readability over performance** (initially)
- **Understanding over memorization**
- **Ideas over implementation details**
